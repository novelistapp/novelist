//! Core UI entry-point
//! 
//! The UI is split along components to make dealing with UI and
//! code changes easier.
//! **What is a component?** â€“ good thing you ask: a component is
//! some piece of UI element that is *atomic*, which means that it
//! makes no sense to break it down any further, without removing
//! the context of it's design.
//! 
//! A pop-over is a component. The text input area is a component.
//! The project sidebar is a component. The master window 
//! is a component. etc, you get the point ðŸ˜‰
//! 
//! Components are clustered into broad categories to make 
//! searching easier. In each category a component is unique.
//! 
//! Inter-component interactions are simply two Rust modules calling
//! functions on each other. Shared state is provided via their parent
//! window.
//! 
//! The master window is parent to all components.
